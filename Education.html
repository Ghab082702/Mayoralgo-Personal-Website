          <h2> PRE-SCHOOL TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL </h2>
          <p> I started my journey as a student at La Immaculada Concepcion School where I study there for 12 years (2007 - 2019). 
              La Immaculada Concepcion School thought me that we should not allow fear to push our minds but we should let our heart 
              guide our dreams. The school is also close to my heart because both of my parents also studied there when they were in 
              their teenage years.

          <h2> SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL </h2>
          <p> My second journey started as a senior high school student at STI College - Global City last 2019. 
              I took an IT in Mobile App and Web Development track. My 2 year stay at STI is great because the 
              school honed my skills as an IT student. I graduated with honors at STI College - Global City. The
              institute thought me some though things that shaped me who I am today.

        <h2> COLLEGE </h2>
        <p> The last journey of my academic career was at Adamson University where I graduated
             as cum laude and top of my class on Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
              The adventure I made was a roller coaster ride, there a lot of ups and downs but 
              the university molded me to become a person who I'am today.
